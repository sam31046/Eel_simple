# Eel_simple
An eel demo made by Jhong, Dong-You.  
  
The eel_launcher.py is based on Proladon's code: https://github.com/Proladon.  
* On Pycharm, you can run app.py directly without running eel_launcher.  
* On Visual Studio, run eel_launcher first.  
* I add a function of choosing button color.  
* Yet, on macOS, it does not work well.
